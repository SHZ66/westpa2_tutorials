# UNDER CONSTRUCTION - WORK IN PROGRESS
# Suite of WESTPA 2.0 tutorials: Supplementary information
This collection of files is a companion to the Suite of WESTPA 2.0 tutorials manuscript soon to be published 
in [LiveCoMS](https://livecomsjournal.org/index.php/livecoms/). Each tutorial directory contains all files 
necessary for completing that tutorial. Programs such as WESTPA, Amber, Python etc. will need to be 
installed by the user and are not provided herein. The following is a list of all tutorials with their 
classification.

If you're interested in WESTPA 2.0, see our [WESTPA Developer's Guide](https://github.com/westpa/westpa/wiki/WESTPA-Developer's-Guide).
